Hii everyone.....

what if you trying to login a webpage and that login page gives you different expression in diffrent area.

i mean the page already contain a background image, then you enter your username the main background image doesnt change,
until you click the password box. if you click the password box , login page change its background in to another image. and also if you leave the password box it return to the main image.

okey then...
what if the login page show you error like you cant login the page due to the some reason of username and password incorrect?
then the backgound is changed again and u can see a video playing in background as a crying because of u cant login.
